# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
**I spent a lot of time trying to make connections with classmates so that we all have people to talk to over the break, so I had a little struggle with scheduling this work. I also struggled initially with fixing some syntax errors, I think I really need to focus on those or I'm going to run into more trouble down the line.**
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
**Note taking is going well, I find myself actually taking the most useful notes when talking with another student and having a breakthrough on a problem we're working on. Being able to write the solution down in a way that includes the thoughts of two people helps it stick in my brain a lot more, and it's been useful to refer back to to help other people later on.**
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
**I usually try to break down *what* needs to be solved, then move from there. I started doing this after one of our earlier challenges, where I sort of wasted a lot of time trying to reason through something without checking whether it seemed like I needed more tools. I think breaking down challenges into large goals, small goals, and the first actionable steps has been very helpful.**
